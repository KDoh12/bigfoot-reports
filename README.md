## Sources

Bigfoot data was obtained from [ESRI Training Services](https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/TrainingServices::-bigfoot-sightings/explore). This data is to be used for training, demonstration, and educational purposes only.

State boundaries were obtained from [Natural Earth](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/) and then transformed into an optimized GeoJSON file using mapshaper.
